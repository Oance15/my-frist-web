    <h3><a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_Dacia" target="_blank" >1.Dacia 1310</a></h3>

    <p>In order to reduce the time between the design and the launch of a car into mass production, the <strong>Romanian</strong> authorities considered it necessary to produce a car under license from a foreign manufacturer. The license was wanted for a mid-range car with a cylinder capacity between 1,000 and 1,300 cm3 and to produce between 40,000 and 50,000 cars per year. Renault, Peugeot, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Austin participated in the tender. The following models were also tested: Renault 10, Peugeot 204, Fiat 1100D, Alfa Romeo 1300, Austin Mini[20]. The decision was made at party level that the Dacia plant would produce cars under Renault license. Due to technical and economic reasons, Renault's offer for the Renault 12 model was withdrawn. The model was in the testing phase, and production was supposed to start in France in the second half of 1969. But the contract was signed in September 1966. Renault allowed the Romanian side to start assembling an intermediate model earlier until the Renault 12 was ready for production. At first, the Renault 16 model was chosen, but in the end, the Renault 8 model was chosen. In the first half of 1983, the 1410 Sport coupé model went on sale,[7] first presented in 1979 at the EREN and in production since 1981.[4] It was produced at Dacia service Brașov, and was initially exhibited under the name Brașovia. The wheelbase and length of the model were about 200 mm shorter, the height was about 135 mm lower, but the boot volume remained unchanged. The engine with which the model was equipped was 1,397 cm³ (bore x stroke: 76x77 mm) and produced a maximum power of 65 horsepower at 5,250 rpm, an increase obtained by modifying the engine bore (from 73 to 76 mm), changing the compression ratio (to 9.8:1) and equipping it with a new carburetor. Reducing the height of the rear suspension lowered its center of gravity, but it is believed to have negatively affected its driving stability.</p>

<!-- Dacia Pick Up -->

<div class="Dacia-Pick-Up"> <h3><a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacia_Pick-Up" target="_blank"  >2.Dacia Pick Up</a></h3>
    The Dacia Pick-Up (or Dacia Papuc as it was popularly called) is a range of pick-up cars manufactured by the Dacia factory. These were the only models in the 1300 series to be produced at the factory after the launch of the Dacia Logan. They were based on the Renault 12 model developed in the early 1970s by the French car manufacturer Renault. It was produced between 1975 and 1982, was equipped with a 1.3-liter, 54 HP engine, the same one that was also found in the Dacia 1300 sedan, and had a payload of 550 kg. Dacia 1302: 2-door pick-up, developed on the technical platform of the Dacia 1300, appeared in 1975 and was produced until 1982. It was equipped only with a 1300 cc and 54 hp engine. The payload was 550 kg. 155SR13 tires. Some owners replaced the 1300 cc engine with the larger 1400 cc engine, for better torque and to be able to cope with higher loads more easily.
    Dacia 1304 Pick Up: 2-door pick-up with folding doors or fixed sides, manufactured between 1981 and 2006
    Dacia 1304 Drop Side: 2-door pick-up with folding side doors and rear door, manufactured between 1983 and 2006
    Dacia 1304 King Cab: 2-door pick-up with rear bench and folding rear door, manufactured between 1994 and 2003
    Dacia 1305: front-wheel drive versions of the 1304
    Dacia 1307 Double Cab: 4-door pick-up with double cab, folding rear door, manufactured between 1992 and 2006
    Dacia 1309: 4-door pick-up with a shorter body, derived from the Dacia 1310 Break, manufactured only between 1992 and 1998. It is almost identical to the Dacia 1302, but different from the 1304, and is directly derived from the Dacia break, having its back, has a rear hatch and a load of about 450 kg. It has front-wheel drive. It was available with both the 1400 cc and 64 hp engine (and the derated 58 hp version) and the 1600 cc 72 hp. It had both 4-speed and 5-speed gearboxes. Many models were exported to China, but they were also exported to countries such as Greece, Hungary, Bulgaria.

<!-- ARO -->
    <div class="ARO"> <h3><a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARO" target="_blank">3.ARO</a></h3>

       ARO (Auto România) was a manufacturer of off-road vehicles from Câmpulung-Muscel, <strong>Romania.</strong> It began production in 1957 and produced over 380,000 vehicles, two-thirds of which were exported to over 110 countries (before 1989, 90% of production was exported). The history of the ARO plant begins in 1885 when, due to its favorable location, a paper and cellulose factory of the "Letea Bacău" company was being built. The factory ceased its activity in 1899, and in 1933 it was decommissioned. Between 1941-1944, the place was used as a warehouse for materials by the army, and from 1944 for almost a year, a section of propeller blades for airplanes belonging to the "I.A.R. Brașov" Factory operated here. Between 1945 and 1950, repairs were carried out here on means of transport belonging to the Romanian and Soviet armies. After 1950, for 3 years, locks, vermores and sprinkler pumps for agriculture and viticulture were produced.
       In 1953, the factory refocused on the production of motorcycles, producing a total of 12 units of the IMS 53 model.
       In 1957, the production of car spare parts (gearboxes and engines) began, a year that coincided with the start of the production of IMS 57, M59 and M461 off-road vehicles. Until the first layoffs, most of the inhabitants of the neighboring communes worked at the ARO plant. In 1944, the factory area was 6,000 square meters, reaching over 35,000 meters in 1973, of which 15,000 square meters represented built-up area. Between 1950-1974, global production increased 397 times, merchandise production increased 290 times and the number of employees increased 10 times.
       It worked in 3 shifts, and the factory had a capacity of 20,800 cars per year. Since 1994, it has worked in 2 shifts, and the capacity was 14,000 cars per year.

<!-- Oltcit -->
<div class="Oltcit">
<h3><a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltcit" target="_blank">4.Oltcit</a></h3>

    Oltcit emerged as a result of a partnership between the <strong>Romanian</strong> state authorities (government) and the French car manufacturer Citroën. Thus, a year later, in 1977, in Craiova, the construction of a modern factory for the construction of a small car began. In 1979, at the EREN exhibition in Bucharest, meaning "Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy", the new Oltcit car brand was officially launched, which had two variants: with a 652 cc and 36 HP engine and with a 1130 cc and 56 HP engine. The new Oltcit cars were to be mass-produced starting in 1980. Production continued under the name Oltcit until 1991, when the name was changed to Oltena (and the logo was also changed); because Citroën decided to withdraw from the association. Production of these versions continued until the signing of the contract with the Daewoo company, when another name change took place, from Oltena to Rodae.
    Four versions were produced at the factory:
    Special - equipped with a 652 cc engine from Visa and LNA.
    Club - equipped with a 1129 cc engine and a 4-speed gearbox.
    Club 12 TRS - initially equipped with a 1200cc engine, but replaced with a 1299cc engine and a 5-speed gearbox; it was a car intended for export to France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Ecuador, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Colombia, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, Bulgaria.
    Club 12 CS - available since 1993, two-seater pickup truck; 1299 cc engine and a 5-speed gearbox with power-enhancing ratios.

    <!-- Malaxa -->
<div class="Malaxa">
    <h3><a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaxa_(automobil)" target="_blank">5.Malaxa</a></h3>
    
    Malaxa was a prototype of a Romanian passenger car built in 1945 in Reșița in the factories of the <strong>Romanian</strong> industrialist Nicolae Malaxa, whose name it bears. The car had a three-cylinder radial engine, with forced air cooling, capable of developing 30 horsepower (according to measurements of the time). The constructive solution was "all in the back", the engine forming a whole with the differential and gearbox. The weight of the engine was 80 kg and the assembly with the differential and gearbox reached 150 kg. To ensure the cooling of the engine, a space was left between the ceiling and the roof for the necessary air ducting. The air was captured from the front, above the windshield and was ducted through the double-walled roof, with the help of a fan, which absorbed it, directing part of it over the cylinders, and the rest to the carburetor. The maximum speed was 120 km/h. The Malaxa offered a high level of comfort and could carry up to six people. The body had an aerodynamic, very elegant shape, with the luggage compartment in the front, under the hood, where the spare wheel was also located. The body was attached to the chassis by rubber pads. Gasoline consumption was 10 l/100 km. The Romanian press between 1945 and 1947 reported extensively on the Romanian automobile project. In September 1945, Timpul mentioned, within an exhibition of peacetime products of military factories, held at the "Romanescu" primary school on Mihai Vodă Street 42, Bucharest, the presentation of a model made at the "Malaxa Study Circle", characterized as follows: "transports 5 people, 2 large and 2 small suitcases; speed 105 km. per hour; gasoline consumption, 8 l per 100 km., simplified maintenance, comfort, safety. Between March and May 1946, Scânteia and România viţia announced the imminent completion of the prototype, during May 1946, built through the collaboration of the A.S.A.M. Cotroceni and I.A.R. Brașov factories. According to them, "A.S.A.M. manufactured the chassis, suspension and steering elements, as well as a large part of the engine components", and "I.A.R. was responsible for manufacturing the body and some high-precision engine parts." [5][6][7] Other press reports emphasized that the car, designed by engineer Petre Carp, developed 35 horsepower and consumed 10 liters of gasoline per 100 km, [8] and its price was estimated at 850 dollars. [9] Gazeta Sibiului also noted for the first time that the car would be called "Malaxa".
